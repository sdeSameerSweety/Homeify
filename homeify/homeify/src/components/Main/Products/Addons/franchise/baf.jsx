      <p class="p1">We have been in partnership with Pepperfry since 2020, when we launched our first Franchisee Studio with them in Vizag. With the smooth experience we had, we launched our second studio at Vijayawada and our 3 rd studio at Guntur. it has been a great journey. The team at Pepperfry has been very supportive right from the time we signed-up. We are happy to partner with India’s leading home and furniture marketplace.</p>

      <p class="p1">Partnering with Pepperfry proved to be a game-changer for my existing business. The team at Pepperfry helped me set up the entire studio and functions in a matter of 45 days. We launched Studio Pepperfry at Trivandrum, in Dec 2018 and had 3,500 customers within a year of its launch. Since then, I launched three more Pepperfry Franchisees. With Pepperfry, we can deliver anywhere in India. We now cater to the whole of India as a market.</p>

      <p class="p1">While researching for business opportunities, we came across Pepperfry. We wanted to weigh it right, so two weeks on, we visited their Mumbai Head Office. We were so impressed with the experience that we signed up for the franchisee and on the 42nd day, Studio Pepperfry Coimbatore was Open for Business. We have been in partnership with Pepperfry since 2019 and today we have 5 franchisee studios with them.</p>
