          <p class="p1">
            Located on the ground floor, the flooring, lighting, furniture,
            electricals, and material finishes needed to be designed.
            Three-metre-high windows in the north and east have horizontal glass
            louvres in wooden frames to let in light, which fades towards the
            back. “Lights, which are made of folded laminate sheets and cotton
            scraps in plastic polycarbonate sheets that represented clouds in
            the sky were used near the ceiling to give the space a distinctive
            feel. These diffuse very bright light since the budget did not
            include dimmers,” One spherical pendant lamp is suspended above a
            table, its size almost that of the work surface below it. The shell
            is white, with no false ceilings. All electrical connectivity is
            from open wiring in the ceiling, permitting changes and revisions.
