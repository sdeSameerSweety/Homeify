            Furnitech seating systems , was earlier limited to dealer network in
            select states for selling their products . But when We started
            selling on Pepperfry in 2015, it really opened up the audience for
            us . The kind of reach and popularity that Pepperfry has in India as
            an online marketplace , has expanded our sales to every corner of
            the country .
